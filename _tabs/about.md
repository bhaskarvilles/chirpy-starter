> **About Me**:
> Certified Ethical Hacker
> Full Stack Developer
> System Administrator
> Block-chain Ecosystem Developer
> DevSecOps
> Open-Source Contributor
> Software Reverse Engineering
> Recently, I completed an Professional degree Bachelor's in Pharmacy at the Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University.
> I am also the technical expert at dark web hackers. My expertise is programming, running exploits, setting up DDOS attacks and i like the challenge of doing things where most others give up. I can "recover" passwords of most social networks easily, remote control smartphones, and most other things that are useful because i spent years to find methods that really work. Here you can find a list of my services in shop and send me an encrypted message, if it is not listed, then minimum price will be $600 and we will discuss the final price once you gave me all information and i accept the job.
